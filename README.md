# Brasileirão Team Statistics

- This project aims to webscrapping data from WhoScored website and generate `csv` files that we can latter work on.

- For now, there's only a simple function to gather data, and it might not be very intuitive.

- You might have a lot of work to get the urls (just like in my `year_option` list), but you can easily access it in the inspect element of dropdown list and then copy the source code.

- In the near future I pretend to make a better function, in which you put the name of the country, year, your driver path and then just wait for the `csv` output. 

- If you want to take a look at the dataset I just created with this simple function, you can [check it out in Keggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rodrigobrust/brazil-soccer-teams-statistics-20142020)
